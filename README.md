Correlating FRB Location And Substructure of Hosts

This is a package to determine the likelihood of an FRB having been observed at a given location, given an image of the host and a model of its smooth structure. Likelihoods can be calculated for a number of different assumed probability density distributions based on the observed host galaxy light, a model of the host galaxy, or some residual of the observed galaxy minus model.
